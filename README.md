## Design

### Colour Scheme

From the outset of building this site I new that it would take its key design features from one image. The image would be used as a background for the body of the site, and this background would feature across the site, tieing together the overall aesthetic and vibe. The image needed to be tropical, exotic in order to connect with the clients key demographic. I came across an amazing image on [Unsplashed](https://unsplash.com/) by a photographer called <a href="https://unsplash.com/@chrisabney">Chris Abney</a>. The image is of a stunning rainforest and perfectly connects with the demographic and key design approach for the site. Using the image I was able to deside a colour palette to use across the site that would compliment the image, and fit with my design brief. I used a website called [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), and uploaded the image by Chris Abney into its "create palette from photo" feature. I've inlcuded a list below of colours I ended up settling on:

* #002416 - Dark Green
* #114634 - Brunswick Green
* #02661D - Pakistan Green
* #9CC24D - Android Green
* #24171B - Raisian Black

### Typography

Rubik is the font chosen for use across the site, with Sans Serif as the back up font in case there are any issues importing into the site correctly from Google Fonts. As I do with all my projects I research different fonts, to find the best one that would work with my design brief. Recently I came across an article by [awwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) website called the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/20-best-web-fonts-from-google-web-fonts-and-font-face.html">20 Best Google Web Fonts</a>. This article is full of some fantastic fonts, but I felt Rubik would work best due to its bold and modern appearance.

# Features
Each page of this site shares the same header and navigation bar. The header contains the clients logo and navigational links to all areas of the site. The navigation bar runs the length of the page and is fixed to the top of the page throughout the site. The navigation bar contains the company logo, which acts as a link to the "Home" page. In addition it has a drop down menu for the three category of products that are on sale on the site. These categories are "Empty Terrarium", "Full Terrarium" and "Terrarium Accessories". Next to the drop down is a link to the "Share Your Builds" page. The far right of the navigation bar is a link to the "Account" and "Cart" section of the site. The colour of the font used in the navigation bar is black with a white background colour. This is the only area of the site with this colour combination. This is because I wanted to the user of the site to associate this colour combination with navigation, making it easier to navigate across the site. 

<b><i>Home</i></b>
I wanted the Home page to have all of the information a first time visitor could require, and hopefully turn them into a returning visitor. However, I didn't want the home page to be too overbearing. As mentioned in the Design section of this Readme I've used the same image across the site as the background image. This image connects with the clients key demographic, in combination with the complimentary colours I've used for the call to action buttons, and areas with key information. I used cards with semi transparent backgrounds, they catch the visitors eye and the white font allows the text to pop. 

The Home page is split into three sections. The first section has three identical call to action buttons, which take the visitor to the three categories of the web store, "Empty Terrarium", "Full Terrarium" and "Terrarium Accessories". The e-commerce experience is the primary function of the site, and so its critical that the user can navigate to it with as little clicks as possible. The call to action buttons use the same hover and focus CSS as the other call to action buttons across the site, this keeps the aesthetic consistent. The second section of the Home page is the About Us section, informing the visitor exactly who the company is, what they stand for and what they have for offer. The third and final section of the Home page is split into two sections one directing the user to the area of the site where they can register for an account. The section section is directing the user to the section of the site they can log in assuming they have already registered for an account. Although the web store is a vital section of the site, all the key features of the site are enhanced when a user has registered an account. Therefore, allowing the user to register an account, or log in easily is paramount.
