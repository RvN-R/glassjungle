## Design

### Colour Scheme

From the outset of building this site I new that it would take its key design features from one image. The image would be used as a background for the body of the site, and this background would feature across the site, tieing together the overall aesthetic and vibe. The image needed to be tropical, exotic in order to connect with the clients key demographic. I came across an amazing image on [Unsplashed](https://unsplash.com/) by a photographer called <a href="https://unsplash.com/@chrisabney">Chris Abney</a>. The image is of a stunning rainforest and perfectly connects with the demographic and key design approach for the site. Using the image I was able to deside a colour palette to use across the site that would compliment the image, and fit with my design brief. I used a website called [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), and uploaded the image by Chris Abney into its "create palette from photo" feature. I've inlcuded a list below of colours I ended up settling on:

* #002416 - Dark Green
* #114634 - Brunswick Green
* #02661D - Pakistan Green
* #9CC24D - Android Green
* #24171B - Raisian Black

### Typography

Rubik is the font chosen for use across the site, with Sans Serif as the back up font in case there are any issues importing into the site correctly from Google Fonts. As I do with all my projects I research different fonts, to find the best one that would work with my design brief. Recently I came across an article by [awwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) website called the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/20-best-web-fonts-from-google-web-fonts-and-font-face.html">20 Best Google Web Fonts</a>. This article is full of some fantastic fonts, but I felt Rubik would work best due to its bold and modern appearance.

# Features
Each page of this site shares the same header and navigation bar. The header contains the clients logo and navigational links to all areas of the site. The navigation bar runs the length of the page and is fixed to the top of the page throughout the site. The navigation bar contains the company logo, which acts as a link to the "Home" page. In addition it has a drop down menu for the three category of products that are on sale on the site. These categories are "Empty Terrarium", "Full Terrarium" and "Terrarium Accessories". Next to the drop down is a link to the "Share Your Builds" page. The far right of the navigation bar is a link to the "Account" and "Cart" section of the site. The colour of the font used in the navigation bar is black with a white background colour. This is the only area of the site with this colour combination. This is because I wanted to the user of the site to associate this colour combination with navigation, making it easier to navigate across the site. 
<hr>
<b><i>Home</i></b>
<hr>
I wanted the Home page to have all of the information a first time visitor could require, and hopefully turn them into a returning visitor. However, I didn't want the home page to be too overbearing. As mentioned in the Design section of this Readme I've used the same image across the site as the background image. This image connects with the clients key demographic, in combination with the complimentary colours I've used for the call to action buttons, and areas with key information. I used cards with semi transparent backgrounds, they catch the visitors eye and the white font allows the text to pop. 

The Home page is split into three sections. The first section has three identical call to action buttons, which take the visitor to the three categories of the web store, "Empty Terrarium", "Full Terrarium" and "Terrarium Accessories". The e-commerce experience is the primary function of the site, and so its critical that the user can navigate to it with as little clicks as possible. The call to action buttons use the same hover and focus CSS as the other call to action buttons across the site, this keeps the aesthetic consistent. The second section of the Home page is the About Us section, informing the visitor exactly who the company is, what they stand for and what they have for offer. The third and final section of the Home page is split into two sections one directing the user to the area of the site where they can register for an account. The section section is directing the user to the section of the site they can log in assuming they have already registered for an account. Although the web store is a vital section of the site, all the key features of the site are enhanced when a user has registered an account. Therefore, allowing the user to register an account, or log in easily is paramount.
<hr>
<b><i>Product Page </i></b>
<hr>
As mentioned previously the e-commerce aspect of the site is its main purpose. Therefore displaying the product avalaible on the site was an important feature to get right. This would be the first step in the users journey to complete a transaction. The products are divided into three categories "Empty Terrarium", "Full Terrarium" and "Terrarium Accessories". To make the decision process more simple for the user, each product category has a small, medium and large option. Keeping it simple not only speeds up the decision process and leads to more sales, but from a design perspective it lends itself to a simple and refined design. Therefore, I decided that each category should have its own identical product page. The Product page like all the rest of the website has the navigation bar consisting of the company logo and navigation links appear at the top of the page to ensure consistency throughout the site. Just below that is a heading with the category title. The main content of the page is a card. Each sized product  has its own card, with an image of the product, the title of the product and a brief description. The background of the card is slightly transparent, in combination with the white text catches the users eye, and denotes the information displayed is important and worth taking notice of. Each product image within the card is a link to the associated products "Product Detail page". The user can click the product they are interested in, and this then progresses the user forward in the transaction journey.
<hr>
<b><i>Product Detail Page </i></b> 
<hr>
The Product Detail page is the next step in a user completing a transaction. Once again the navigation bar is situated at the top of the page, should the user decide they are no longer interested in the product they are viewing, and want to navigate back to the rest of the products on the site. Just below the navigation is a heading with the title of the product. Unlike the Product page the Product Detail page just has a single card in the middle, with the same background colour and font as all the other cards across the site. In the card is a larger image of the product, this image also acts as a link. Once clicked by the user it opens and even larger image of the product in a modal, for the user to have a closer look of the product to aid in the decision process. Below the image is a description of the product, the manufacture name of the product and the price. Below that in another paragraph is the quantity section of the card . This section allows the user to increase or decrease the amount of the product they potentially would like to purchase. The minus button will decrease the quantity and the addition button will add to the quantity. Below the quantity section are two very important call to action buttons, "KEEP SHOPPING" and "ADD TO CART". Until this point we have yet to come across a call to action button that takes you back and doesn't progress the users transaction journey. I wanted the colour combination to be different from other call to action buttons. This is why the "KEEP SHOPPING" button is "Android Green" with different hover and focus CSS effects. This call to action button allows the user to keep shopping should they not be interested in adding this particular product to there cart. Once clicked the button will take the user back to "Home" so they can carry on choosing which product they want to purchase, or just carry on using the site. Should the user want to purchase then they can click the "ADD TO CART" call to action button, which uses the same colour palette as the other progress call to action buttons. This then adds the product to the Cart, the Cart icon in the top right hand corner will change colour and display the price of the product. In addition to that a success toast will appear just below the Cart Icon. Both of these functions denote to the user that they have been successful in adding the product to there cart. Right at the bottom of the card is the review section for that product, allowing an account holder to leave one review for that product. 
<hr>
<b><i>Cart Page </i></b>
<hr>
The next step in the transaction process would be the Cart Page. Assuming at this point the user has visited a few Product Detail pages for products they wish to purchase, and have added them to there Cart. It was important to me that the Cart Page displayed key information to the user, effectively in order for them to want to progress the transaction process. Once again the navigation bar is situated at the top of the page, should the user decide that they want to add other products to the cart. Just below the navigation is a heading notifying the user that they are viewing there cart. Below that is a table that displays all of the key information a user would require in order to progress the transaction. This includes Product Information on the products in the cart, which feature an image of the products and the name of said products. To the right of the product information is the price for a single unit of the product. To the right of that is another quantity section, similar to that found in the Product Detail page. This provides the user another opportunity to either increase or decrease the amount of said product they would like to purchase. Once again the minus button will decrease, and the addition button will increase the quantity. Should the user want to use this feature they then click the "Update" call to action button just below the "Qty" section which then updates the cart. However, should the user decide that they are no longer interested in said product, the "Remove" call to action button once clicked will remove that product from the cart and update the cart total. Should the user decide to remove all of the products from the cart, the page will notify the user that there cart is empty, and direct them to continue shopping with the "KEEP SHOPPING" call to action button.  To the right of the quantity section is Subtotal, which takes the price, multiples that by the number in the quantity section and displays the total. The user can scroll down the Cart Page, working there way down the table. At the bottom of the table is the "Cart Total" which adds the all of the sub totals together. below the "Cart Total" is the "Delivery".  A great deal of the products on this site are high value items, so to incentivise users to purchase there is free shipping on all purchases above £200. If the Cart total is above £200 then "Delivery" will be free, if not just below "Delivery" will be text notifying the user how far off there total is from free shipping. Below "Delivery" is the "Grand Total" notifying the user the grand total of there cart. At the bottom of the page is two call to action buttons, "KEEP SHOPPING" and "SECURE CHECKOUT". "KEEP SHOPPING" allows the user to reverse the transaction journey, should they want to add more products to there cart. Should the user be happy with there choices they can click the "SECURE CHECKOUT" call to action button taking them to the Checkout Page. 
<hr>
<b><i>Checkout Page </i></b>
<hr>
The next step in the transaction process would be the Checkout page. At this point during the users transaction journey they have confirmed exactly what they want from the site, and are committing to purchasing it.  Once again the navigation bar is situated at the top of the page. Just below the navigation bar is a heading notifying the user that they are on the Checkout page. Just below the heading is a card taking up most of the page content, as with all cards on the site it carries the same design aesthetic. Within the Card to the right hand side of it is an Order Summary, this includes all of the key information from the Cart Page, notifying the user exactly what they are purchasing and how much it is costing them. To the left hand side of the page is a form for the user to fill out in order to complete the transaction. It was important for the client that we allowed none account holders to purchase, should a user just want to make a one off transaction and not utilise any of the sites other features. The form asks for the user to fill out "Full Name", "Email Address", delivery information and finally there card details. Should the user be logged into an account the delivery information from there profile will automatically fill out these fields. Just below the payment text input field are two call to action buttons, similar to the Cart page "Adjust Cart" and "Complete Order". The "Adjust Cart" call to action button uses the "Android Green" colour pattern as it denotes to the user that they going back a stage in the transaction journey. This button once clicked takes the user back to the Cart Page for them to amend there cart. The "Complete Order" button once clicked processes the users payment information. If the form isn't valid then it will come back with information on what needs to be amended. If its valid then the Checkout Success page with appear. This page will be a summary of the transaction, and will notify the user that confirmation of the transaction will be emailed to the email address inputted in the checkout form.

<hr>
<b><i>Register </i></b>
<hr>
As mentioned allowing the user to register an account was a key requirement for the client, and there are two ways of a user navigating to register page. Providing the user isn't already registered then a link to register an account will appear towards the bottom of the home page. The other way of navigating to the register page is via the navigation bar. The navigation bar is located at the top of the page no matter where the user is on the site. On the right hand side of the navigation bar you will see a person icon with "My Account" just below it. Once clicked it activates a drop down with the link called "Register". Once clicked the user will be taken to the "Sign Up" Page. They will see a heading at the top of the page notifying them that they are on the "Sign Up" page. Below the heading is a form for the user to fill out in order to create an account. Once the user has filled out there email address, username, password at the bottom of the form is two call to action buttons. One called "BACK TO LOGIN" and "SIGN UP", should the user have an account then "BACK TO LOGIN" will direct them to the login page, alternatively should the user wish to register it will submit the form they have filled in and register an account. Once successfully submitted a Verification Sent page will appear notifying the user that an email has been sent to them to verify there account. Once verified the account is setup, and the user is logged in.  

<hr>
<b><i>Log Out </i></b>
<hr>
Should the user decide to log out of there account I wanted to make this a simple task for them with as little clicks as possible. By this point the user should connect anything and everything to do with there account can be found on the top right hand corner of the navigation bar, where an icon of a person with "Account" underneath it appears. Due to the fact the navigation bar is situated in the same place site wide, it should be simple for the user to navigate there. Once clicked a drop down appears, and providing they are signed in to there account it will have two options "My Profile" and "Logout". By clicking "Logout" the user will be taken to the logout page, where they will be asked if they are sure they want to log out. By clicking "CANCEL" they will be taken back to the "Home" page, if they click "SIGN OUT" they will be logged out of there account. 

<hr>
<b><i>Log In </i></b>
<hr>
Should the user decide to log in to there account I wanted to make this as simple as logging out with as few clicks as possible. By this point the user should connect anything and everything to do with there account to the navigation bar.  In the right hand corner of the navigation bar theirs an icon of a person with "Account" underneath. Due to the fact the navigation bar is situated in the same place site wide, it should be simple for the user to navigate there. Once clicked a drop down appears, and providing they are logged out of there account they will have two options "Register" and "Log In". By clicking "Log In" the user will be taken to the log in page, where they will be asked if they have yet to create an account, if so their will be a link to register an account. Assuming they have already registered they can sign in with there user name, or email address they used to register. They would then input their password and then click the "SIGN IN" call to action button, which will sign them in and then the "Home" page will appear. In the top right hand corner just below the navigation bar, a Success Toast will appear notifying the user they have successfully logged in. Should the user decide they don't want to log in then there is also a button called "HOME". Instead of clicking "SIGN IN" by clicking "HOME" they won't be signed in, instead they will be taken to the "Home" page. 
<hr>
<b><i>Profile </i></b>
<hr>
The client wanted to offer the user the option to look at there previous purchases, should they have registered an account and be logged in when a purchase was made. Once again first time and returning visitors should associate anything and everything to do with their account to person Icon with the label "Account" on the navigation bar.  Once clicked a drop down appears, and providing they are logged into there account they will have two options "Profile" and "Log Out". Once the user clicks "Profile" they are taken to there profile page. The page will have a title "My Profile" denoting that they are on there profile page. Similar to the Cart and Checkout page the main content of the Profile page exists inside a card, as with all cards on the site it carries the same design aesthetic. On the right hand side of the card is the Order History section. This section is a table and shows all of the users order history, including  the "Order Number", "Date" of the purchase, "Items" that were purchased and "Order Total". The order numbers in the "Order Number" column are links, so once the user clicks one of these links it will open the "Checkout Success" page for that order. On the left hand side of the "Profile" page is the "Default Delivery Information". This section of the page allows the user to fill out what they want there delivery information to be. If they have already filled this out, and want to update they can re-fill out the form, click the "UPDATE INFORMATION" button at the bottom of the from and that updates the information. Next time they go to purchase there delivery information will be pre filled with this updated information.
