## Testing client Requirements featured in README
* **We need a platform that aesthetics connect with the companies key demographic**
I did a great deal of research into the clients demographic by visiting sites of there competitors to see how they connect with the demographic. From the research I found that the demographic wanted to connect with nature, and recreate that in there living spaces. I felt that using a high resolution image of a Rainforest as the body's background throughout the site would tap into that need of connection to nature. I then used a colour palette across the site that complimented that background image. 

* **We need a platform that succinctly explains who we are and the function of the company.**
The home page is the first page a user will arrive at, in the center of that home page is an "About Us" section that explains succinctly the function of the clients company. 

* **We need a platform that succinctly explains how to navigate across the site, no matter the device used to view the site.**
The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the page no matter the device the user is using to view the site. As a result within a few clicks the user knows that the navigation can always be found at the top of the page. In addition the navigation is the only area of the site with a white background and black text. Subconsciously the user associates this colour combination with the navigation of the site.

* **We need a platform that allows those visiting to register an account with us.**
There are a number of ways for the user to register an account on the site. I've included a link on the home page, to entice first time visitors of the site to register. In addition should a user find there way onto the log in page and hasn't actually registered, then a description "if you have not created an account yet, then please sign up first" is featured on the page and the words "sign up" act as a link to the register page. Thirdly should a user click the "My Account" link on the top right hand corner of the navigation bar and are not logged in then the drop down has a link called "Register". 

* **We need a platform that allows those who have registered an account to log in and log out freely**
There are a number of ways for a user who has already registered to log into and log out of their account. Firstly, their is a link on the home page that directs those who have registered an account to log in. In addition if a user has yet to log in then the "My Account" link on the top right hand corner of the navigation bar will have "Log In" in its drop down. If the user is logged in and wants to log out then they can go back to the "My Account" link on the top right hand corner of the navigation bar. In its drop down menu they will see "Log Out" once clicked they will be asked if they want to log out, once confirmed a success toast message will appear just below the right hand corner of the navigation bar confirming the user has successfully logged out. 

* **We need a platform that allows those who have registered to review products.**
I've created a function which will allow those users who have registered an account to leave a review with a rating on a product. They will be prevented from leaving more than one review, but they will be able to edit or delete said review. 

* **We need a platform that allows those who have registered to share an image and a description of there own terrarium builds**
I've created a a feature of the site called "Share Your Builds", which allows those users with a registered account to upload an image of their builds, with a brief description of the image itself. 

* **We need a platform that allows users to purchase product**
I've built a number of apps within the project that allows registered and non registered users to view all of the product avalaible on the site, add product they want to purchase to a cart, amend that cart, progress the cart to the checkout and purchase and place an order for those items. 

* **We need a platform that notifies users who have registered an account to document there previous purchase history.**
Providing a user has registered an account once they have logged in if they go to the "My Account" link on the top right hand corner of the navigation bar and click the icon the drop down should appear with "Profile" in it. The user can click the "Profile" link and be transported to their Profile page. The page will display there shipping information on left hand side (that can be amended) and their purchasing history on the right. They can click any order number and that will open a summary of the order. However, the user has to purchase product logged into there account, if they aren't logged in when they purchase then that purchase won't appear in there history. 

## Testing User Stories from UX section in README
### Testing First Time Visitor Goals

 1. <b>As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site, and learn more about the company.</b>
 * The "About Us " section on the home page features 3 paragraphs explaining the companies values. 
 
 2. <b>As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find key content.</b>
 * At the top of each page is a navigation bar that runs the length of the page. It's fixed at the top of the page and allows the visitor, no matter where they are on the website, to know the location of the navigation bar.

3. <b>As a First Time Visitor, I want to clearly find out how to register for an account.</b>
* There are a number of ways for the user to register an account on the site. To entice first time visitors of the site to register, I've included a link on the home page. The user will see a large heading that says "Want to register an account?", with a paragraph on why they should register an account and a link which takes them to the register page.

4. <b>As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to find out what products the site offers.</b>
* To keep things simple the client has divided there product portfolio into three categories "Empty Terrariums", "Full Terrariums" and "Terrarium Accessories".  At the top of the home page are three large buttons that allow the user to navigate to three pages associated with the three main product categories. This helps the user start there transaction journey with as little clicks as possible. Alternatively on the navigation bar is a drop down list entitled "Terrariums". Once clicked a drop down list appears with all three product categories appearing. The user is then able to click which one they are interested in, and then they are transported to pages associated with these categories and the products within said category. 

5. <b>As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to choose what product I want and complete a transaction.</b>
* Assuming the user has followed the journey discussed in point 4. they will have reached a product category page. This page will display all of the products associated with said category. If the user is interested in anyone of these products they can click on the image of the product that interests them. This will take them to a product detail page. An image of the product they are interested in will appear, along with a description and an opportunity to either return to the home page and continue there journey through the site, or add that product to the cart. They can even increase or decrease how many of these products they may want to purchase. Once added to the cart, the user can click on the cart icon at the top right hand corner of the navigation bar at the top of the page. Once on the cart page then can click the "Go To Secure Checkout" button to complete there transaction. 

### Testing Returning Visitor Goals

1.  <b>As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to log into my account quickly.</b>

* As mentioned covering previous visitor goals towards the bottom of the home page there is a link that directs those who have registered an account to log in. In addition if a user has yet to log in then the "My Account" link on the top right hand corner of the navigation bar will have "Log In" in its drop down. The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the page, and so returning users will know exactly where to go in order to log in. 

2.  <b>As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to register an account if not already.</b>
* There are a number of ways for the user to register an account on the site. I've included a link on the home page, which main function it to entice first time visitors of the site to register. If a returning vistor over looks this link then they can utilise it in order to register an account. In addition should a user find there way onto the log in page and hasn't actually registered, then there is a link to the register page. Thirdly should a user click the "My Account" link on the top right hand corner of the navigation bar and are not logged in then the drop down has a link called "Register".

3.  <b>As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to visit my profile easily.</b>

By clicking one of these call to action buttons the user will be transported to the product category page associated with that button. They can click on the image of one of the products that catches there interest, transporting them to that products product detail page. Once there they can scroll down to the bottom of the page to the "Customer Review" section. They can click the "LEAVE A REVIEW" button. Providing they haven't already left a review they will be able to fill out the review form. Providing they have filled out the form correctly once they click "ADD REVIEW" then the review is uploaded to that product.  

5. <b>As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to leave a post on the Share Your Builds Section of the site easily.</b>
* I wanted to allow users with registered accounts to post on the Share Your Builds section of the site.

If the user is on a device with a smaller screen the main navigation will toggle down to a remote view navigation. However once the user clicks the toggle icon the link to "Share Your Builds" will appear. Once on the "Share Your Builds" page the user (needs to be logged in) can scroll to the bottom of the page and click the "CLICK TO SHARE YOUR BUILDS" button.
